# Wordle-Clone
A Java based clone of the New York Times owned game, Wordle.

## How To Play
* The goal of the game is to guess a hidden 5-letter word randomly chosen at the beginning of each game.
* There are up to 6 attempts to guess the word.
* After each guess, the colour of the tiles will change to show how close the guess was to the actual word:
  * A green tile indicates that the letter is in the word and in the correct position.
  * A yellow tile indicates that the letter is in the word but in the incorrect position.
  * A grey tile indicates that the letter is not in the word.
